# Neural-Network-Basic-Implementation
Implementing basic neural network with Python + numpy. Assignment 2 of Soft Computing class

Consider a neural network with two inputs, two hidden neurons, and two output neurons. Additionally, the hidden and output neurons include a bias, and the activation function is TanH. Write down the Delta Rule for updating weights and perform the weight updates for one iteration. Also, write python code for same and find updated weights after 10 iterations.
Consider initial weights of your choice.
